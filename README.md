# Tic Tac Toe - check out the **[demo](http://dev.pascalbruno.com/tictactoe)**
### a multiplayer tictactoe game powered by firebase...

This is a universal tic tac toe board game built to try the firebase API.  This board sync the plays across devices and browsers as you play. You can sit and watch people play as well.

Todo (if time permits):
- Check for a winner
- Create game session and invite people to play
- More to come...


This project is just an experiment just to learn NodeJS and Socket.io.  For now the sync is done using firebase, as I progress in the development I will be using socket.io
